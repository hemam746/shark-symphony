# Shark-symphony
Shark Symphony is a project where sharks might go to feed in the ocean. It uses satellite data like temperature, chlorophyll, and noise to find hotspots. You can click on the map to explore these spots and see how sharks behave—whether they’re feeding, escaping noise, or swimming normally.
